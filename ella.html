    <h1>Ella – The Hidden Jewel of Sri Lanka’s Highlands</h1>
    <img src="assets/ella.jpg" alt="Ella" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 10px; margin: 1.5rem 0;" />

    <p>
      Tucked into the heart of Sri Lanka's Central Highlands, <strong>Ella</strong> is a captivating village that feels like it belongs in a dream. With its mystical cloud forests, lush green tea plantations, and peaceful energy, Ella attracts travelers from around the world. It is not just a scenic destination — it’s a spiritual and cultural experience that bridges nature and tradition.
    </p>

    <h2>Historical & Cultural Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      The region surrounding Ella has been inhabited since ancient times. Its location along royal travel routes made it a strategic resting point for kings and monks traveling between the kingdoms of Anuradhapura, Kandy, and Ruhuna. Local legends link Ella to the Indian epic <strong>Ramayana</strong>, where it is believed King Ravana held Princess Sita captive in nearby Ravana Ella Cave. This legend forms an important part of local storytelling and cultural memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the British colonial era, Ella was transformed into a key area for tea cultivation. British planters established estates such as the Halpewatte and Uva Halpe, leaving behind tea bungalows, railway infrastructure, and even churches that still echo colonial charm. Many locals continue to work in these estates, maintaining traditions passed down for generations.
    </p>

    <h2>Natural Beauty & Environment</h2>
    <p>
      Ella’s biodiversity is remarkable. Its elevation, around 1,041 meters (3,415 ft), creates a cool climate perfect for tea, cloud forests, and rare bird species. The town is a gateway to the <strong>Uva Province's</strong> ecological treasures, including native orchids, butterflies, and medicinal plants. Morning mists rising through tea plantations create an otherworldly scene — ideal for photographers, painters, and anyone seeking serenity.
