    <p>
      Nestled along Sri Lanka's southwestern coastline, <strong>Galle Fort</strong> is a mesmerizing blend of ancient grandeur and modern charm. Enclosed by majestic ramparts overlooking the Indian Ocean, this historical site is the largest preserved sea fort in Asia built by European occupiers and is now a living testament to centuries of colonial influence, maritime power, and multicultural heritage.
    </p>

    <h2>Historical Timeline</h2>
    <p>
      The story of Galle Fort spans over 430 years:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1505:</strong> Portuguese explorer Lourenço de Almeida landed in Galle, beginning European interaction.</li>
      <li><strong>1588:</strong> The Portuguese built the initial fortified structure with palisades and watchtowers.</li>
      <li><strong>1640:</strong> The Dutch East India Company captured the fort and rebuilt it with stone ramparts, bastions, and a complete urban layout.</li>
      <li><strong>1796:</strong> The British took control and used the fort as an administrative center while preserving its Dutch architecture.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Through colonial conflict, trade expansion, and maritime exploration, Galle remained a critical port in the Indian Ocean until the rise of Colombo. Today, it’s recognized as a <strong>UNESCO World Heritage Site</strong> (since 1988), praised for its intact preservation and urban cohesion.
